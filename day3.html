It’s easy falling into you
Like velvet ropes in shades of blue
You speak in ways the sky might do
And I forget what’s false or true
I watched the way you lit your smoke
Like every breath was something broke
You said, “Don’t make me soft again,”
But pulled me in and kissed my hand

You always laugh when I go deep
But darling, that’s just how I speak
You told me I was hard to hold
But still, you never let me go

I think I knew you in a dream
I think I knew you in a dream
You wore that look I’ve always seen
Like someone hiding in between
Oh yeah, I’ve known that voice before
Like static playing through my floor
I think I knew you in a dream
And now you’re real to me

My interest is to stay too long
To trace your name into a song
And build a world where we belong
No exits, just the sinking sun
My interest is to lose my pride
To let your chaos match my tide
And if I say too much too soon
Then let me drown and call it truth

You said I scare you when I care
Like love that’s deeper isn’t fair
I see you watching me unlace
Your armor just to touch my face
And God, it hurts the way we fit
Like we’re too sharp, but still commit
We’re wreckage dressed up in perfume
You hold me like a living wound

I think I knew you in a dream
I think I knew you in a dream
Like déjà vu that made me scream
Like soft destruction underneath
Oh yeah, I’ve felt your breath before
Like poetry behind closed doors
I think I knew you in a dream
And now you’re haunting me

And if you leave, I’ll still believe
You were a part they didn’t see
You’re in my lungs, you’re in my skin
I think I knew you
I think I knew you then...

    hey cutie, these are songs i wrote, they're both sharing the same lyrics. i am not the one singing this obviously i had to go through some stuff to get it autotuned since ai stuff was kind of messed up
    i didn't give any texts in day 2 but is your sister's birthday coming? happy birthday to her from me ^^. i hope you're doing wonderful. i have been listening to this song for a while, personally i like veil, 1st one more than the 2nd.
    i am not talented enough or experienced enough to do it all by myself so i took help AI to understand how to do stuff, I DIDN'T COPY STUFF OK I would rather not give stuff than copy it honestly. 
    I love you deeply.
    ~Volon
