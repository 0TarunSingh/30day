hey jiji,  
i don't even know how to start this without smilin' because just thinking about you already makes my chest feel warm.  

when we first started talking again, i never really thought we would end up making many little moments that would mean so much. but here we are, with this whole collection of memories that i wouldn't trade for anything.  

random conversations that made us laugh, every silly little inside joke that no one else would get, they're all stuck in my head the best way.  

even the quiet moments where we just talked about life or gave each other advices on things, felt different. better. there's just something about you that makes everything lighter and more alive.  
i know it may be hard right now, but soon it will all get much better. way better. there's just something about you that makes everything lighter and more alive.  

i love how we were just ourselves till stuff happened, it was so fun. as much as i want it all back, you getting better is much more the priority.  
you can say anything random and it brightens my day.. even the silly small talks, the pfp finding one, i really felt the time fly that day. i learned how much i enjoy spending time with you.  

you're like my team mate, my soul mate, and god knows how many other mates we are. the days nothing felt right, that you were around for me, the way we've shared so much even though we didn't really know each other that well after the years.. it still felt like i had known you forever. you're my safe place, the one who somehow understands me when i can't even explain myself.  
a lot of things between us is more real, much more real than people "in person" have had.  

i love you, not halfway, not from a distance in my heart. i mean i love all of you, every part of you. the happy, the tired, the ridiculous, the strong, and the moments you're hurting. i'll still choose you every single time.  
you're my favorite person, my happy place, my adventure, and i have the feeling that it's only just beginning.
      </p>
